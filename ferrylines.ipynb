    "Quantum computers have been in development for quite a while. They are intended to solve various problems that scale too violently even for supercomputers. Thus, D'Wave has already started its development since 1999 on quantum computers.\\[3\\] The aim of this Jupyter notebook is to check the current state of the art for feasibility. For this we will try to solve an example on the quantum computers and processes provided by D'Wave. In the following, we will therefore use the D'Wave software libraries, which are intended to enable efficient use with quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example is a shipping route optimization. A CSV list is given as input, in which the connections of the various ports are listed. The goal is to find the shortest route from a starting port to the ending port. The list is in the data_harbours_utf8.csv dataset. An output of the route is therefore expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to solve this example using D'Wave's methods. We use two different methods for this: Constrained Statisfaction Problem(CSP) and Constrained Quadratic Model(CQM). With these two methods, we have the option of either providing direct input to the quantum computer or using D'Wave's hybrid process.\n",
    "In addition, we will look for the optimal solution with classic algorithms in order to have a validation of the result.\n",

    "On a small set of data, all three algorithms were able to find the correct solution. Djikstra is considered a comparison here, since the solution is calculated individually and is therefore seen as correct. The processing times are not relevant because they are too short.\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation is different with a larger data set. With the CSP, the stitch function took too long and was therefore aborted. The reason for the long execution time has already been explained in the execution of the stitch-function. The other two algorithms were able to calculate the route with negligible time.In order to see a difference in time, a significantly larger data set would have to be read."

    "As can be seen, quantum computing can already be created with problems. With the small example of the ferry route optimization, the desired solution could be determined with the CQM model using quantum computing. A solution could also be found with the CSP for the small data set, but with the large data set you can see that it leads to scaling problems and runtimes that are too long. Thus, there is a barrier in creating the optimization function in the case of the CSP. More research would have to be done here in the direction of creating an optimization function.\n",
    "In order for the statement as to whether quantum computing can already be used in practice to be answered, one would also have to work with larger data and with exponentially scaling problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, yes, you can solve problems today with quantum computers. To what extent and what limitations there are still needs to be worked out further."
