    "Quantum computers have been in development for quite a while. They are intended to solve various problems that scale too violently even for supercomputers. Thus, D'Wave has already started its development since 1999 on quantum computers.\\[3\\] The aim of this Jupyter notebook is to check the current state of the art for feasibility. For this we will try to solve an example on the quantum computers and processes provided by D'Wave. In the following, we will therefore use the D'Wave software libraries, which are intended to enable efficient use with quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example is a shipping route optimization. A CSV list is given as input, in which the connections of the various ports are listed. The goal is to find the shortest route from a starting port to the ending port. The list is in the data_harbours_utf8.csv dataset. An output of the route is therefore expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to solve this example using D'Wave's methods. We use two different methods for this: Constrained Statisfaction Problem(CSP) and Constrained Quadratic Model(CQM). With these two methods, we have the option of either providing direct input to the quantum computer or using D'Wave's hybrid process.\n",
    "In addition, we will look for the optimal solution with classic algorithms in order to have a validation of the result.\n",
